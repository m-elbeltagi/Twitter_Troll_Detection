# Twitter_Troll_Detection
This is the code for a text classification project that aims to distinguish real from "troll" (or rather tweet-farm generated, paid political tweets). 3 models were used to compare their performance. (1) A distilled version of a pretrained LLM with fixed weights for encoding the text, and a binary classification head trained on top of it,(2) A pretrained smaller version of a LLM now its weights adjustable by the training process to be finetuned, along with a binary classification head, (3) and finally a new few-shot learning technique called SetFit (https://huggingface.co/blog/setfit) taht dramatically decreases the number of examples needed for training by using contrastive learning.
A full report on the project (along with a poster the we're going to present at a competition in a couple of weeks) is currently being written, and will be posted soon.
